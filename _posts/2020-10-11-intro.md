# Hello

Hi, my name is [...], I live in [...]. By day, I am a semiconductor design
automation engineer hopped up on coffee and bad posture. By evening I am a dad
and husband. Not often enough, I am a son and brother.

I probably should have started this blog many years ago... back when I was
still learning the ropes of technology design and had vigor and enthusiasm. At
this point, I'm a grumbly old fart too tired to explain things in great detail.
So I am not sure how much good this blog is going to do.

In fact, I have started many blogs, but never published them. I always have
reservations about disclosing my personal life and interests on the internet.
Still do, so probably you will not see me disclose anything about myself on
purpose. If anything I'll just post random rants and writings that range from
esoteric Assembler and Tclsh code to minute liturgical nuonses of the Benedictine
Divine Office (of which I am completely unqualified to do so).
